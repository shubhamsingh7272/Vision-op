## Project Background 🌟

This project was developed as part of exploring the intersection of:

-   Real-time video processing
-   3D visualization
-   System monitoring
-   Web technologies

The goal was to create an interactive tool that combines these technologies in a unique way.

## Fun Development Stories 🎮

-   Discovered interesting patterns while implementing point cloud shapes
-   Overcame challenges in real-time data streaming
-   Learned about WebGL and Three.js optimization
-   Experimented with different visualization techniques

## Tech Stack Evolution 📚

Started with basic webcam streaming and evolved to include:

1. Three.js for 3D visualization
2. Flask backend for system metrics
3. Real-time data processing
4. File handling system
