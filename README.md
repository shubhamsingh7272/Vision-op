# Vision-op: Tele Operator Application

# Author: Shubham Singh

A web application that displays a laptop camera feed alongside point cloud visualization. The system handles real-time camera streaming, provides basic metrics, and includes recording capabilities.

## Features

1. **Point Cloud Visualization**:
   - Implements a 3D room viewer.
   - Includes basic camera controls: zoom, rotate, and pan.
2. **Camera Integration**:
   - Streams the laptop's webcam feed to the web interface.
   - Displays basic stream metrics.
   - Offers a recording functionality.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shubhamsingh7272/Vision-op.git
   cd Vision-op
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the backend folder:
     ```bash
     cd teleoperator-backend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Run the backend server:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the frontend folder:
     ```bash
     cd teleoperator-frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the frontend server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

## Technical Decisions

- **React.js**: Chosen for its efficient component-based architecture and seamless state management.
- **Python**: Used for backend operations and file handling due to its simplicity and robust libraries.
- **Point Cloud Library**: Enables interactive 3D visualization and manipulation of point clouds.

---

## Known Limitations

- The application assumes a stable internet connection for streaming and recording.
- Performance may degrade with high-resolution streams on older devices.
